🛸 UFO Sightings Analysis

This project analyzes UFO sightings data using Python, exploring trends, geographic distributions, and patterns over time. The project leverages data cleaning, visualization, and pivot table analysis to uncover insights from real-world UFO sighting reports.

📊 Project Overview


The analysis includes:

- Data Cleaning
  
  - Handling missing values and inconsistent date formats.

  - Converting columns like Date_time into a consistent datetime format.

- Data Visualization
  
  - Trends of UFO sightings over the years.

  - Geographical distribution of sightings (latitude/longitude).

  - Seasonal, hourly, and shape-specific insights.

  - Regional and state-level UFO shape distribution.

- Pivot Table Analysis
  
  - Summarizing data to explore the frequency of UFO shapes reported by region.

📈 Key Insights


- Yearly Trends:
  
  - UFO sightings increased sharply after 1995, peaking around 2012.

- Geographic Distribution:
  
  - Most sightings were reported in the United States, particularly California.

- Seasonal Patterns:
  
  - Sightings peak during summer and autumn, likely due to clearer skies and outdoor activities.

- Hourly Analysis:
  
  - Sightings are most frequent between 8 PM and 11 PM, with a sharp decline after midnight.

- Shape Distribution:
  
  - The most commonly reported shapes are "Light," "Fireball," and "Circle".
